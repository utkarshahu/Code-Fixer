```javascript
function sum() { 
  return a + b; 
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`function sum() { ... }`**: This line defines a function named `sum`. The parentheses `()` indicate that it's a function, and in this case, it doesn't take any arguments. The curly braces `{}` enclose the function's body, which contains the code to be executed when the function is called.
*   **`return a + b;`**: This line is the core of the function. It calculates the sum of two variables, `a` and `b`, and then returns the result. The `return` keyword is used to send the calculated value back to the part of the code that called the `sum` function.

**How it works:**

1.  When you call the `sum()` function, the code inside the curly braces `{}` is executed.
2.  The function attempts to add the values of the variables `a` and `b`.
3.  The `return` statement sends the result of `a + b` back to the caller.

**Important Note:**

This function will only work correctly if the variables `a` and `b` are defined and have numerical values before the function is called. Otherwise, you might get unexpected results (like `NaN`, which means "Not a Number") or errors.
